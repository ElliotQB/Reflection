<h1>Reflection</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a project I worked on for a game development class. It was made using raylib-go and sees the player as a square jumping on platforms at ascend. The screen is mirrored down the middle, and each platform is only displayed on one half of the screen at random. The player must cross reference each side of the screen to figure out where the next platform is.

<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
Download [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [go](https://go.dev/doc/install), then, with the directory open in a console, type ``go run``
